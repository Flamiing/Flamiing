## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **backend-focused Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in **systems programming (C)** from the 42 School curriculum, complemented by experience in **Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ and PHP**.  
I love building clean, reliable, well-structured software — whether it’s low-level logic, backend services, or containerized deployments.

I like building robust backend systems and understanding the logic behind them, while also applying modern development practices and clean engineering principles.
